                I am currently in my second year at the University of Washington Bothell studying business and a prospective 
                Human Centered Design and Engineering student. I want to combine my business and UX background to translate business 
                objectives into responsible and satisfying user experiences.  
            </p>
            <!--Created a bulleted list of the research I'm in-->
            <p>Here are some research I have partcipated in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pathways: Mapping HCDE Career Experiences </li>

            <p>
                During quarantine I have been watching Netflix, running, biking and working on research. I have been working 
                with <strong>Jason Yip</strong> on the <em>Creepy</em> Project trying to understand what creepy technology means to kids. 
                For my other research project I have been conducting semi structured interviews 
                with UX Leaders to understand the pathway to leadership! I am currently looking for more research experience for the summer

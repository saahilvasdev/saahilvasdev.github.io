    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore studying Computer
    Science and Software Engineering. I am taking this
    introductory course because I wanted to add another
    computer "language" under my belt. I've always been 
    fascinated with websites and this was a great opportunity
    to learn more about it.</p>

    <p>The best way to contact me is through my email
    at skv21@uw.edu or by cell phone 425-463-7846. I am
    always looking for opportunities involving software 
    development.
